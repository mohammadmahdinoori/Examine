# Examine
A contrastive approach for measuring the semantic similarity of persian academic questions based on Transformers in deep learning.

# What is Examine
Examine is a platform for measuring the similarity of persian academic questions based on deep learning techniques, maninly Transformers and especially Google's BERT model. In this work we conducted a research on various nlp techniques in the field of text similarity and various techniques on OCR epecially when images include LATEX besides natural language. In addition, we tried to come up with a novel deep learning model for efficient text similarity.

# Text Similarity
Text Similarity is the problem of measuring the similarity of given pieces of texts in terms of real-valued scores. Text Similarity is mainly done by learning a meaningful latent represetnation of texts which can be then used for similarity measurement. In other words, we first learn a model which is used to encode the meaning of each piece of text into an n-dimensional vector, and then use common distance functions like cosine-similarity or euclidean distance as the similarity factor for the obtained vectors. In this scenario, similar vectors in embedding space or latent space represent similar texts and un-similar vectors represent not similar texts in terms of meaning. Overall, we aim to learn a model which can satisfy explained factors.

## Common Models For Text Similarity
With the advent of Transformers and attention-based models, especially google's BERT model, Text Similarity is mostly done by BERT and other similar variations like RoBERTa, DeBERTa and etc.
